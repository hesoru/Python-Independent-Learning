# Python: Independent Learning
### Some tutorial scripts I wrote when learning Python!

### IMPORTANT: tutorial 3 requires installation of sample data
before running the script for tutorial 3, install enhancer_status_with_genes_and_expression.tsv (on GitHub in hesoru/Python_Learning) and rename "C:/Users/Helena/405_Linux_outputs/Gene_subsets/enhancer_status_with_genes_and_expression.tsv" in line 119 to your own file path
