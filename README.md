### Some tutorial scripts I wrote when learning Python!

#### IMPORTANT: tutorial 3 requires installation of sample data
before running the script for tutorial 3, install enhancer_status_with_genes_and_expression.tsv (on GitHub in hesoru/Python_Learning) and rename the file path in line 119 to your own file path
